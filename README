Knight Short and Minimum step Path Solver


Given a chess board, find the shortest distance (minimum number of steps) and path taken by a Knight to reach given destination from given source.

The idea is to use BFS algorithm to solve this problem.

Getting Started


git clone https://github.com/epsil0n0/knight.git

cd knight

docker-compose up -d




example to send a request to /solve api in POST method:


curl --location --request POST 'localhost/solve' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"n":8,
 "start_x":0,
 "start_y": 7,
 "end_x": 7,
 "end_y": 0
}'


output:

{"Minimum number of steps required is": 6, "The complete path is:": [[0, 7], [2, 6], [4, 5], [6, 4], [4, 3], [6, 2], [7, 0]]}
